## Stay Calm And Read Smashing  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/monthly-roundup-03-2020/

It all started in Freiburg, Germany, and the team consists of folks scattered all over the world &mdash; with most of us not working fulltime for Smashing.That’s right, working remotely is quite familiar to us, and so with the current situation going on with COVID-19 that is making everyone uneasy, we’d like to make the best of things and help our friends who are having to work or lead teams remotely for the first time. ` Iris Lješnjanin : Fri, 13 Mar 2020 12:30:00 +0000`
