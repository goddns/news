## How To Build A Music Manager With Nuxt.js And Express.js  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/02/music-manager-nuxtjs-expressjs/  
Handling digital media assets such as audio and video in your application can be tricky because of the considerations that have to be made server-side (e.g. networking, storage and the asynchronous nature of handling file uploads). However, we can use libraries like Multer and Express.js to simplify our workflow on the backend while using Nuxt.js (Vue framework) to build out the front-end interactions.Whenever a web client uploads a file to a server, it is generally submitted through a form and encoded as multipart/form-data. ` Deven Rathore : Thu, 27 Feb 2020 13:00:00 +0000`
