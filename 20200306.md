## Introducing Alpine.js: A Tiny JavaScript Framework  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/introduction-alpinejs-javascript-framework/  
Like most developers, I have a bad tendency to over-complicate my workflow, especially if thereâ€™s some new hotness on the horizon. Why use CSS when you can use CSS-in-JS? Why use Grunt when you can use Gulp? Why use Gulp when you can use Webpack? Why use a traditional CMS when you can go headless? Every so often though, the new-hotness makes life simpler.Recently, the rise of utility based tools like Tailwind CSS have done this for CSS, and now Alpine. ` Phil Smith : Wed, 04 Mar 2020 11:30:00 +0000`
