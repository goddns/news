## When You Find A Good Idea, Look For A Better One  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/ideas-prototypes-tips-design-process/  
Design is about solving problems. No matter what product we work on, we always try to provide the best possible solution to our users. Product research, ideation, prototyping, and testing are essential steps of the product design process. The ideation phase plays a crucial role in the design process because, during this phase, designers form hypothesesâ€”raw ideas on how to solve the problem. But every hypothesis, no matter how good it might sound, always requires validation. ` Tony Kim : Tue, 03 Mar 2020 11:00:00 +0000`
