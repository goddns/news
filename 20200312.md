## Make Honest Design Work For Digital Business, With “Ethical Design Handbook”  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/ethical-design-handbook-release/  
Many business models thrive on ingeniously deceptive and manipulative digital products. Not because they have to; mostly because dark patterns have become such an accepted norm. But what happens when ad-blockers, cross-browser tracking protection and data regulation (e.g. GDPR &amp; CCPA) become a norm, too? That's when an honest, ethical design could be a competitive advantage.To grow a sustainable business, we need to learn how to leave dark patterns behind. ` Vitaly Friedman : Tue, 10 Mar 2020 12:30:00 +0000`

## Creating Secure Password Flows With NodeJS And MySQL  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/creating-secure-password-flows-nodejs-mysql/  
If you’re anything like me, you’ve forgotten your password more than once, especially on sites you haven’t visited in a while. You’ve probably also seen, and/or been mortified by, reset password emails that contain your password in plain text.Unfortunately, the reset password workflow gets short shrift and limited attention during application development. This not only can lead to a frustrating user experience, but can also leave your application with gaping security holes. ` Darshan Somashekar : Wed, 11 Mar 2020 11:30:00 +0000`
