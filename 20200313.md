## Accessible SVGs: Inclusiveness Beyond Patterns  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/accessible-svgs-inclusiveness-beyond-patterns/  
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) became a W3C open standard in 1999 &mdash; back when the new tech hotness was the Blackberry phone, Napster first invaded college dorms, and the Y2K bug sparked fear in us all. Fast forward to our modern digital world and you‚Äôll notice that while the other tech trends have waned, SVGs are still around and thriving. This is partly due to SVGs having a small footprint for such high visual fidelity, in a world where bandwidth and performance matter more than ever &mdash; especially on mobile devices and situations/locations where data is at a premium. ` Carie Fisher : Thu, 12 Mar 2020 11:30:00 +0000`
